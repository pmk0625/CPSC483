Data Set: Data Collection vs Training Data
Difference -> Training Data consists of class (eg. dog or cat, low, 
moderate, high risks)

3 requirements for Machine Learning Algorithm : 
Input Data -> Goal of Learning -> Outcome

Supervised Learning (requires training data)
requirements:  Training Data -> regression or classification -> output
regression -> predict using continuation values
classification -> predict using categorization

Unsupervised Learning
clustering -> grouping for association

For given X (new data):
function f used to predict a CONTINUOUS value, y_hat, it is called 
REGRESSION
function f used to predict a DISCRETE value, y_hat, it is called 
CLASSIFICATION

In Linear Regression Model,
X -> independent variable
Y -> dependent variable
beta -> coefficient
w -> weight
epsilon -> random variable
